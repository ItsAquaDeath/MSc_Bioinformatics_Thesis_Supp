# MSc_Bioinformatics_Thesis_Supp
Repository dedicated to archive supplementary material developed during my master's thesis work. TL;DR We aimed to express diferent CRISPR-Cas13 systems in *E. coli* as a model organism to study how RNA collateral cleavage of this nuclease could module a transcriptomic response.

In this repo, there is both useful data (sequences, counts matrix, etc.) and some scripts (edgeR analysis, mapping bash script...) that were fundamental towards the completion of the MSc in Bioinformatics that I took during 2022-24.
